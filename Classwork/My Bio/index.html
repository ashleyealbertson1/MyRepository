  <h3>Ashley Albertson</h3>
    <img src="http://placehold.it/200/200" alt="My cool picture" />
    <p>Ashley has lived in Texas her whole life and is very familiar with the north Dallas area.  She grew up in Plano and attended the University of Texas at Tyler where she earned a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing and graduated Summa Cum Laude. 

      After graduation, Ashley launched her career in digital marketing and online sales.  Ashley has spent the better part of 10 years developing, implementing & managing digital marketing campaigns and heading up online sales efforts in small multi-million dollar companies and global coporations for both B2B and B2C channels. 
            
      Throughout her career Ashley has been incredibly passionate about taking excellent care of her clients and strives to exceed expectations in all that she does.  "If my customers wouldn't give me a 15 out of 10 and aren't saying how above and beyond I went on their behalf, then I'm not doing my job." 
      
      As well as taking care of her customers professionally, Ashley genuinely cares about them on a personal level.  "I have been through unique and significant challenges in my life that only God could bring me through.  My goal in life is to show my clients and those around me the same grace, compassion, love and kindness God has shown me." 
      
      While Ashley has celebrated numerous professional and personal achievements in her life, her greatest achievement and greatest joy is being a mom.  Her top priority in life is to raise a happy and wonderful little boy who will become an upstanding young man who will bring more kindness and compassion into the world. </p>
