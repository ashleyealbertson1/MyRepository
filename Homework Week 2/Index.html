                <p>Ashley has lived in Texas her whole life. She grew up in Plano and attended the
                    University of Texas at Tyler where she earned a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing and graduated Summa
                    Cum
                    Laude. Ashley attended Southern Methodist University (SMU) where she obtained her Full Stack Programming Certification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She has spent the better part of 10 years developing, implementing & managing digital marketing campaigns and heading
                    up
                    online sales efforts in small multi-million dollar companies and global coporations for both B2B and
                    B2C
                    channels. Ashley is very excited about her recent career change and is looking forward to embarking on a new journey into the programming world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Ashley has celebrated numerous professional and personal achievements in her life, her
                    greatest
                    achievement and greatest joy is being a mom. The best thing you can invest in is your children - they are the future. Her top priority in life is to raise a
                    happy and wonderful little boy who will become an upstanding, responsible, and self-sufficient young man who will bring more kindness
                    and
                    compassion into the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a personal note, Ashley genuinely cares about people - employers, colleauges, clients and friends
                    alike - on a personal level. "I have been through unique and significant challenges in my life that
                    only
                    God could bring me through. My goal in life is to show those around me the same
                    grace,
                    compassion, love and kindness God has shown me."
                </p>
                <p>My Mantra: I believe that challenges are really opportunities to improve yourself and your situation if you have the right mindset (so stay positive!).
